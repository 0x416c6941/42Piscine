# Piscine at 42 Prague
A collection of my solutions to exercises in Piscine at *42*.
<br>
C00 - C09 have all passed with **100%**, others haven't been checked
by Moulinette.
<br>
<br>
Please also take a note that Norminette uses 4 spaces per tab,
and so all alignments are done exactly with 4 spaces, not 8
(default in *Vim* and *VS Code*).


## Copy-pasting
All sources are published for **educational purposes**.
<br>
Instead of directly copying them,
I highly encourage you to *understand* how some solution works.
<br>
Another good references are source codes of *OpenBSD* and *manpages*.
